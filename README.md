A merger that lets you control the priorities of input connections.

The prio-merger-milestone will show up as soon as you reach the milestone "Logistics" in tier 1. 

The prio-merger-milestone comes with no costs and can be activated immediately.

No prio set. It will act like a normal merger:

![1](https://github.com/hahoyer/fixIt.PrioMerger/blob/main/Resources/PrioMergerNoPrio.png?raw=true "The same prio for all")

Center will be considered first. Right and left are pulled alternately when nothing is present in the center:

![1](https://github.com/hahoyer/fixIt.PrioMerger/blob/main/Resources/PrioMergerPrioCenter.png?raw=true "Center has prio")

Left will be first, then center and right at last:

![1](https://github.com/hahoyer/fixIt.PrioMerger/blob/main/Resources/PrioMergerLeftCenterRight.png?raw=true "Left has prio, then center, then right.")

These symbols indicate what is currently available at each input.
