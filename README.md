This provides an initially hidden milestone **"Priority Merger"**.

It enables a merger that lets you control the priorities of input connections.

The milestone will show up as soon as you reach the milestone "Logistics" in tier 1 and comes with no costs.

This way it can be activated immediately after "Logistics".

## Examples of usage:

### Default
No prio set. It will act like a normal merger:

![1](https://github.com/hahoyer/fixIt.PrioMerger/blob/main/Resources/PrioMergerNoPrio.png?raw=true "The same prio for all")

### Prefer one
Center will be considered first. Right and left are pulled alternately when nothing is present in the center:

![1](https://github.com/hahoyer/fixIt.PrioMerger/blob/main/Resources/PrioMergerPrioCenter.png?raw=true "Center has prio")

### Total order
Left will be first, then center and right at last:

![1](https://github.com/hahoyer/fixIt.PrioMerger/blob/main/Resources/PrioMergerLeftCenterRight.png?raw=true "Left has prio, then center, then right.")

These item-symbols indicate what is currently available at each input.
