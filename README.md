Staying efficient means setting limits. <br>
The vanilla merger lets everything through without restriction.  <br>
The Priority Controlled Merger (PCM) is an adequate solution to this problem, dear pioneer.  <br>
You decide in which order the incoming items are processed.<br>
This way you can make your factory even more efficient.

PCM is unlocked together with the Logistics milestone in Tier 1.

## Examples of usage:

### Default
No prio set. It will act like a vanilla merger:

### Prefer one
The picture shows how to prioritize the central input. Right and left are pulled alternately when nothing is present in the center:

### Total order
In the following example, left is taken first, then center and finally right:

![1](https://github.com/hahoyer/fixIt.PrioMerger/blob/main/Resources/PrioMergerLeftCenterRight.png?raw=true "Left has prio, then center, then right.")

These item-symbols indicate what is currently available at each input.
